## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a desaturated purple (#A29BFE) to convey trustworthiness and reliability, reflecting the financial aspect of the app.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F6FA) to ensure readability and create a professional, clean look. This supports prolonged use without causing eye strain.
- Accent color: Use a slightly brighter blue (#6c76fe) to highlight interactive elements, ensuring they stand out.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, provides a clean and modern feel, good for headlines and labels. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to pair for body text when the headlines are Space Grotesk.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying configuration details.
- Use minimalist and professional icons, filled style, with a consistent stroke width to maintain visual harmony.
- Use a clear, intuitive layout with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, with older users in mind.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on user interactions without being distracting, reinforcing the utility of the interface.
